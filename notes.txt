I'm trying to start my life with my wonderful fiance & golden retriever, so I'm ready to give it my all for them...This means:

You don't need to worry about responsiveness
- I will be one slack message away at the drop of a hat

You don't have to worry about me fitting in
- I'm the nerd who has literally been using Sprint methodologies to build my app

You don't have to expect complacency
- There's nothing I love more than creating cool things and improving at creating cool things. 
- I'm aesthethically driven and results focused. Webstacks does an excellent job of marrying the two, and I'd be ecstatic to contribute to that goal

You won't have to wait forever to see growth
- I'm hungry to improve. I'm eager to devour all the onboarding and training I can. I've always loved experience-based learning so I'll continue to dive into new technology and techniques before and after my onboarding.

You don't need a translator for marketing-speak
- I started marketing because I was always creative, but I quickly found out that I just love building. I'm glad for my marketing degree becuase it helps me think about the end-user at every step.
