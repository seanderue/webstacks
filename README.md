# Webstacks

This website is a tangible example of what I can bring to the table whilst showing my excitement for the Webstacks React Engineer role. The experience was built in only 23 days with the tools & tech you love:



- React for extensible components & state management

- Next.js for static rendering & SEO friendliness

- DatoCMS for headless content hydration

- GraphQL for backend communication

- Vercel for cloud-based hosting

- React-Three/Fiber for unique 3D experience

- Sass for CSS management

There are still a handful of things I would've liked to add onto the project, but I gave myself a deadline. Thankfully a website is never finished, right?
