# Webstacks

This website is a tangible example of what I can bring to the table whilst showing my excitement for the Webstacks React Engineer role.

The experience was built in only 23 days with the tools & tech you love:



React for extensible components & state management

Next.js for static rendering & SEO friendliness

DatoCMS for headless content hydration

GraphQL for backend communication

Vercel for cloud-based hosting

React-Three/Fiber for unique 3D experience

Sass for CSS management

You're welcome to examine the codebase herehttps://github.com/seanderue/webstacks, but
I'd welcome the opportunity to discuss it over an interview ðŸ˜‰.
